-When making a website, you may have to collaborate with others.
Git is a tool to that will help you to do team development smoothly.

-Git is operated from the terminal

-To start of, type 
	$git init //init = initialize

-These are the 3 steps to team development.
	1. Make changes to a file
	2. Prepare to share the changes
	3. Share the changes

- Assume u have some file you want to share say index.html

- Before sharing it we have to make sure that we add that file, which is done by
	$git add file_name

- Once added, we will save the selected files with a message. Then we're ready to share them.

-o record a selected file, run the command 
	$git commit -m "message"
PS:- Message can be anything but its better if it descibes the content of the commit.
	this message is called as commit message

- We call this kind of saving a commit.

- Now the preparation is done

-But, now how can we actually share the files?
Ans: Git uses something called a Remote to store shared files. Developers share files by uploading to and downloading from remotes

-When you add a remote, a name is required. Usually, developers use the name origin.

-More specifically, to register a remote, type 
	$git remote add remote_name URL

-once done we will upload a file to the remote, 
	$git push origin master

- What happen till this was you have uploaded that file to my repository using push now i will download it on my computer by running 
	$git pull origin master
downloading this file or such file is called PULL



POINTS TO BE NOTED

1. In team development, it is important to clearly recognize the changes you have made and select which changes should be shared with your partners. 
2. What kind of files :
	First, it is important to recognize the changes you have made. Using $git status, you can display a list of modified files.
	$git status
3. Now if you want to know what changes are there , then
	$git diff
4. If u accept the changes then just type
	$git add

NOTE:- changes made will appear in green and old one in red

5. if you want to know which file you added use
	$git status

6. Modified code will be displayed, as shown on the right, with the code after in green and the code before in red.


-Final step once done type git commit -m "Message"
 message should be what changes you made and then again, type
	$git push origin master


-Question
You should write commit messages that can be easily understood by others, but how can they even be seen!?
Answer Using command 
	$git log
anyone can view the commits

-if you want to see both the commit messages and the changes that were made, type
	$git log -p
	Q to quit






If you want to download some repository then type,
	$git clone
